At this point, I asked myself some questions asking about three main points: number of deals, profits and effectiveness in the deals.

To do this, first compare the number of deals per country per plan, per channel and then per status. That is the Dashboard 1.
Second i create a new variable called profits, which adds the amounts of each deal, to compare it by country, plan and channel. This is the dashboard 2.
Finnaly, to evaluate the effectiveness of the deals, i create a last variable that counts those deals that are closed, then compare it by country, plan and channel. This is the dashboard 3.
